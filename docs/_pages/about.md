I am a human being trying to find myself. Actually, it just occured to me that this whole "finding my true self" is kind of a bullshit. We are who we decide we want to be and what we decide to do. You are a kind person because you decided to the kind things. You are a cruel person because you decided to do the cruel things. 

I am not trying to find myself. I am trying to build and create myself. To be a person I like. To be a person I love. To be a person I am most comfortable and happy being. ðŸŒž
