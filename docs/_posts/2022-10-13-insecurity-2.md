title: "Insecurity 2"
---
I think I will restart my daily writing because writing helps me clear my mind and calm my soul. I have been feeling restless all day today, even though I have papers to read. I keep checking my phone impulsively and I keep wanting to talk to people. I couldn't seem to focus much on reading either, thus kinda wasting my afternoon away. 

I need to do work in whatever sliver of time I have and not think that I have plenty of time to spare. Because things are going to get busier and busier. 

I have the very first meeting with my supervisor tomorrow and I am not quite ready for it. I am not even sure what I should be doing in preperation for it, except for reading the papers over summer. I guess I should make a list of questions that I wanna ask tomorrow. 

It feels as if everyone has a great social life while I am here in my room feeling restless about it. But then, if you want to be different, you can't do the same things that everyone is doing. It's okay to not have the same great social life as everyone else. Insecurity is slowly creeping upon me again, just when I thought everything was okay.
