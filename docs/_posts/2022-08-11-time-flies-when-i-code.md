title: Time Flies When I Code
---

Time flies when I am coding. I really love coding. I love writing lines of code and googling how to make things work and reading lots of StackOverflow's where people have the exact same bugs as mine. There would always be the gurus with their perfect solutions and explanations. 

The downside is I always feel as if I had done nothing by the end of the day whenever I spend the whole day coding away. Spending a whole day just on 5 lines of code? Yep I just squandered the whole day away. I don't know how to Not spend that much time when I am coding. Because I learn along the way and learning means a lot of googling and reading and trying to understand what's going on. But you don't always get a lot of outcome from that. 

So this makes me stressed out about it. I know I love coding but I hate the fact that I can't get it done in a shorter time. I always end up spending the whole day on a tiny part because half a day is really just not enough. I also can't bear to leave things half done because it feels like I have done nothing. 

Maybe I need to learn that it's okay to leave things as it is today as long as I come back to it again tomorrow.
