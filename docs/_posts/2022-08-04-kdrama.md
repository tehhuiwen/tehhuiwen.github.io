I have just finished binging a Kdrama called "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim". It is a very clichÃ© romance Kdrama about a successful young vice chairman of a large conglomerate and his pretty but capable secretary. They both have related childhood traumas and they get married in the end. 

Why must all kdrama's have an element of romance in them???

We have all been led to think that romance is one of the most precious things in life. And that the ultimate goal is to find someone you love, get married and have kids. The end. Yes, having an intimate relationship with someone is a beautiful thing, but what if you never meet that "someone" in your life? 

One thing I really don't like about the current society is that having a partner, getting married and starting a family is the norm. All the benefits are in favour of people who do that. For example, people who stay single don't get any tax benefits in any aspects. Though if we look at it from the perspective of biology, yes it is the people who get married and have kids who bring more value to the human species in terms of evolution. That's how we can make sure our genes get passed on and that the population doesn't die out. 

As a single individual who doesn't fall under the norm, I will have to find other ways to bring value to my species so that my presence is not a mere waste and I don't get weeded out. ðŸŒ±
