title: "A Call With an Old Friend"
---

Today was another turbulent ride of emotions for me, and I didn't like it. Whenever I have relationship related problems (be it friendships, work mates, family etc), I always want to solve it at once. It is very hard for me to let something sit because the problem builds up in my head and spirals out of control, while I desperately try to rein it in. Because when you are at home, you can't let it show. 

In the evening, I went for my usual run, wasn't in great form. I then had a walk and chatted with my neighbourhood friend, who is a little girl aged 16. (Not little now, but because when I first met her, she was only about 13, so to me she is always a little girl) Chatting with someone in person made me feel a lot better. 

When I came back, an old friend of mine (who is now in the States working and travelling) called me and we finally had a proper chat. (I hadn't talked to him for quite some time) It was really nice to catch up with him again and I am a bit sad that I won't be able to see him in person this time. And I don't actually know when I would be able to see him next. 

Having good friends is important. It is also important to not put all your eggs in one basket.
