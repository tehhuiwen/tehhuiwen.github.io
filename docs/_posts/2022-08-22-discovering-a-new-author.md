title: "Discovering a New Author"

I was tidying some boxes of old things when I opened one and found some chinese books that belongs to my mum. A book with the title 《小姐小姐别生气》caught my eye because it is from a funny short saying that goes like this:

小姐小姐别生气，(Little missy little missy don't be angry,)   
今晚带你去看戏。(I‘ll take you to the movies tonight.)  
你做椅子我做地，(You sit on the chair I'll sit on the floor,）   
你吃香蕉我吃皮。（You eat the banana I'll eat the skin.) 

In short, it's about when a guy makes a girl angry and what he promises to do to make her happy again. My mum told me about it when I was young and as kids, it was just fun spewing it randomly. (Kids love reciting lines that rhyme and make no sense.)

Back to the book. It is by a famous Taiwanese author 刘墉 (Liu Yong), who now lives in New York. He has written a lot of essays and books, and is also an artist. His most famous works are 《超越自己》，《创造自己》and《肯定自己》, which are motivation/self-help books. He writes from his experiences with his son, about what he thinks all sons in the world should know. 

I have not read the three books mentioned above, but I have started on 《小姐小姐别生气》, which is similar but where he writes from his experiences with his daughter instead. It is a very refreshing and entertaining, because it is not your typical motivational/self-help book (where the writer just piles endless advice and wisdom onto you). It feels more like a memoir, where he writes about his daily-life stories and encounters with his daughter. 

I am quite hooked onto it now, and I would definitely get hold of the other three books he wrote about his son.
