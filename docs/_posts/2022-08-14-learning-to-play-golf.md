My dad brought me to a driving range today and I finally go to put some basics that I learnt from Youtube videos into action! Dad also gave me some pointers, which really helped a lot. 

I started off by just hitting the tee, trying to get the basic swing and momentum correct. You don't actually need to exert force to swing the golf club, instead you try to make your movements as in sync as possible with the natural movement of the golf club as you bring it down. The club head is heavy, thus when you bring it down, mass x velocity = momentum! The trick is to move along the direction of the momentum so as much of it is conserved and gets transferred to the golf ball. 

Another thing I felt was that golf is quite a meditative sport. You gotta quiet your inner voice, get into the proper starting posture, focus on your grip and the ball. When you are ready, you pre-swing the club, then bring it down in one continuous swoop and up again, finishing the whole motion in one single movement. I think it takes a lot of practice to get into the "zone" and also move in sync with the golf club's momentum. 

It was really fun trying out a new sport - I really loved it! I never realised how fun it is to learn something new. I hope to utilise this summer well by trying out as many different activities as possible! 

Life is short - do many things!
