title: A Normal Day

I finally found the perfect time to run - about 7pm in the evening. When the sun has almost set, the temperature is cool and running feels good again. I managed to run 4km in a good posture and it felt great. Running after having done a workout also feels better because you are already sweating and your muscles are warmed up. The sweat cools you down while you run and creates a pleasant feeling. 

I didn't get much done today because it was a day out with mum. We initially set out to try a Korean BBQ, but upon arriving, the restaurant looked desolate even though it was peak lunch hour. We ended up trying a pork noodle restaurant nearby which provided free flow drinks. Mum was quite happy with it because the portions were very generous. I like their drinks counter - there were an assortment of drinks to choose from - iced lemon tea, hot coffee, chilled coke, you name it. 

I am currently reading 4 books - The Empire of Pain, Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension, The Black Swan and Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. I have finished Discrimination and Disparities and Born a Crime (by Trevor Noah). 

I should draft out a schedule to help me get more things done. I have been dreading planning because I know I have a lot to do. But the one more day I procrastinate and avoid, the harder it is to get things done! Rome was not built in a day! üèõÔ∏è
