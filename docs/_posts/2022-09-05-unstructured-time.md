title: "unstructured time is wasted time"
---

I have seen this theme mentioned quite often in productivity books and videos - unstructured time is wasted time. Even free time, if left unstructured, you might find yourself doing nothing that was supposed to help take your mind off work and relax. No, binging Netflix or scrolling Instagram does not help you unwind - it only numbs you and distracts you from things that matter. I have personally experienced this and can attest that it is true. When I schedule in activities, like meeting up with my friends or going for pickup during my free time, I feel recharged and my mind refreshed. Likewise, if I just stay in my room and watch Netflix all day, I actually end up feeling like trash at the end of the day.

Unstructured writing is wasted writing.
It's weird, the past few days when I stopped writing daily online, I actually feel as if something were missing. Writing everyday has prompted me to reflect more and think deeper. It's different from writing in my diary because I would let words flow and ramble on, without a proper direction. Writing properly makes me put conscious effort in collecting my thoughts and constructing my words. 

It's the fifth day of September now and I want to start two new 30-day challenge. The first challenge is to wake up right when my alarm goes off. The second one is to do at least 3 hours of deep work everyday. 

Here's to starting anew - it's never too late!
