One thing I don't really like about being at home for a long stretch of time is the feeling of being monitored for what I do. When I am away from home, I am free to do whatever I wanted to whenever I felt like. I don't have this freedom when I am at home. 

Another thing I found tiresome was the need to constantly do housechores. The climate in Malaysia is such that dust gathers easily indoors and I am in charge of hoovering and mopping the house 3 times a week. On top of that, there are other small chores such as doing the all the washing up after dinner and the laundry daily. The humid and hot weather does not help much at all with my moods - I easily get irritated. 

It is a bad excuse but I blame the weather a lot for making me feel lazy, unmotivated and irritated. It also doesn't help that I don't really socialise much here either because to go somewhere, I needed to take the public transport. There is nowhere that I can go on foot. 

There are only 2 more months of summer left, I really hope to snap out of it and make the most out of my free time.
