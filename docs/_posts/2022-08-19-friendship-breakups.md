title: "Friendship Breakup"

Ending any relationship is hard. Letting go of anything that you have put effort into and means a lot to you is hard. 

People don't talk about friendships enough, and there isn't a lot of advice on the Internet either. Society is just too concerned about the romantic relationships, overlooking the importance and the beauty of friendships. 

I just went through a friendship breakup. I was in the wrong, and my friend had decided that they had enough. Their trust and expectations had been broken. It hurt, even though I knew it was mainly my fault. But I could understand why they felt that way. 

It is not easy to accept loss, so I went onto the Internet in search of some advice to help me deal with it better. I came across a [video by Rowena Tsai](https://youtu.be/EmjRfASoewAand) there was a quote mentioned in that video.

> People in your life are like different parts of a tree. Some are roots that keep you grounded. Some are branches that are close to you. And some are leaves that fall out and resprout with a change in seasons. 

The last sentence really resonated with me. It is easier to accept and let go of people when you think of them as leaves that come and go with the change of seasons. 

I don't think I have fully come to terms with it yet, it may spring out suddenly on me again, catching me off-guard with the bouts of sadness. Time will heal it, but one thing I can say is that I was proud of myself for not overreact and for keeping my responses cordial, even though I had the urge to blurt out unkind words.
