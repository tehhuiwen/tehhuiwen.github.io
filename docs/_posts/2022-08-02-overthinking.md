This is a very bad habit of mine - overthinking and over-analysing social interactions and then comparing my situation with that of others. Recently it has been about friends, am I as an important friend to you as her? 

I hate waiting on people. As an example, I easily get ticked off when people don't show up on the agreed time. Especially when they tell you they will be late but they don't tell you how late, it keeps you waiting on the edge. I know that they have their reasons and I too sometimes keep people waiting - although I always try my best not to. In short, one of the easiest way to annoy me is to be late for our meeting. 

But the good thing is that even though I get mad/annoyed easily, I forget about it and let it go quite easily too. This was something that my mum commented about a few years ago but at that time I didn't really think so. 

I hope to slowly get rid of the itch to get annoyed at every little thing and to be a calm person, flowing with the water.
