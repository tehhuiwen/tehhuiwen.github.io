title: Thinking Thoughts
---

Today is a day where I didn't do any thinking, that is why nothing comes to mind now and I don't know what to write about. Not thinking is a bliss because you stuff all your thoughts, tangled like a kitten's yarn, into a box and stow it away. Telling yourself that you will open it later and tidy it up. But you are always afraid to open it, because what tumbles out might be a little monster ðŸ‘¾.

I was looking through my blog and decided I wanted to include more pictures or graphics. Right now it looks very simple and minimalistic - I quite like it. But with pictures I think the blog would feel more alive. Also, I do enjoy creating graphics and drawing things. It's just that they are usually quite time-consuming. But it brings me joy! 

It is actually quite late now and I should get to sleep. Today's post is quite short but at least I showed up. 

May tomorrow be a good day! ðŸ˜Š

p.s. I just realised it's already the 20th of August! Holy damn time really flies!
