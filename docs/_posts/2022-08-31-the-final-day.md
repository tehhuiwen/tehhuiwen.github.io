title: "The final day of my 30-day writing challenge"
---
Today is the last day of August, and also Malaya's independent day! A national holiday for us Malaysians. 

Today is also the last day of my 30-day writing challenge - I made it! Though it was not perfect as there were a few days which I skipped in between, I think it has been a success. Throughout these 30 days, I have learnt more about myself and also how to think deeper. I had been through some emotional roller coasters during that time and have tried to come to terms with my own insecurities. I'm sad that I have become someone who is less sure of herself and constantly doubts her own abilities (because I am the one who knows what I really know). Ever since coming to Oxford, I have become more of a survivor rather than a striver. Maybe it's the type of friends I surround myself with? I don't really push myself anymore, and I think that's sad. I miss the old striving and competitive me. 

If you want to be successful, you have to do what most people don't do. If you want to do what most people do, then you'll become most people. 想要超出人群， 就要拒绝平庸
