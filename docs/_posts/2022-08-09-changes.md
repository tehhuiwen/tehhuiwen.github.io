Today is the first day in a while that I don't feel like a mush!
This shows how big and quick a difference uninstalling Netflix and Instagram from my phone makes. Even though I wasn't highly productive, at least I wasn't sluggish. It felt good. 

I did a 40 minute leg + abs workout from Youtube by @growingannanas. And then I went for a 1km run - it felt great and I think I was experiencing something like a runner's high. You need to maintain a certain pace for some time before you can achieve a runner's high, and the build up is the hard part. Also it can't be too hot - heat really kills. 

There is still a big chunk on my to-do list that I need to plough through. And being discipline isn't easy at all. No good things come easy!

I have that little voice in my head that keeps tempting me to slip back into being a slog, watching shows all day and doing nothing. Resisting temptations is like muscle training. If you give in easily now, you will never get anywhere. But at the same time, resisting temptations is like blowing up a balloon - it will explode sooner or later! The trick is too find a way to slowly release the air so that it never builds up. Or to stop the air pump. 

Remove cues that remind you of the temptation and build new habits that make you forget of them.
