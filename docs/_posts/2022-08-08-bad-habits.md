"Good habits are hard to build but easy to break." I will add another one: "Bad habits are easy to build but hard to break. 

Recently, my lifestyle has been an unhealthy cycle of Netflix binging and time wasting doing nothing. And I hate it but it really is so hard to get out of. Bad habits are an addiction, and addictions are hard to rid of, but it is not impossible. Why are things that are actually good for you always seem as hard as climbing Mount Everest? Going for  a run is hard but I feel great afterwards. Working and learning new things is hard but I feel accomplished after.  

I have skipped 2 days of writing, that is the 6th and 7th of August. Going forward, I will do my best to make sure there are no more skips. 

On a side note, uninstalling Instagram really has made me feel tons better - I don't feel insecure or lonely anymore. I have just uninstalled Netflix too, so hopefully with all the time cleared up, I will start chiseling away at my mountainous tasks and not find some other drug substitute. 

Reminder: it is always better to do something than nothing at all. 
Even if it is just 0.001 of something, it is better than 0.
