title: "Moods and Mess"
---
I am in such a mess now (psychologically) and I am not sure what I should do. I am not going to write out reasons here because they feel a bit too private to be on the Internet, but no one really knows me anyways. It's just me being embarrassed about it. 

I probably shouldn't have wrote this out because it might reflect negatively on me but I thought, we are all humans, and who doesn't have a bad phase they go through? So as long as we pick ourselves up after and move on with life. 

I think this is a practice for me. A practice to handle mental challenges, to be more resilient, to get through mentally tough times without being hard on myself. Negative thoughts really come by easily, it takes effort to cast them away and get out of the self-destructing cycle. 

If you are in a mess and are reading this now, hey it's going to be alright. You are sad, you are feeling like shit, you just want to forget about all the bad things. You can cry it out, it's okay. 

I think I need to learn how to give back to people more, how to contribute to people, how to give love. It is in giving that we find release.
